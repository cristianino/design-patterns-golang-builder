# My Go Builder Project

This example Go project demonstrates the use of the Builder design pattern to build complex objects step by step.

## Project Structure

- **cmd/myapp/main.go:** Main entry point of the application that kicks off the execution.
- **pkg/builder/builder.go:** Implementation of the Builder pattern.
- **internal/car/car.go:** Definition of the Car object and car-specific logic.

## Execution

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/cristianino/design-patterns-golang-builder`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd design-patterns-golang-builder`
4. Run the application: `go run cmd/myapp/main.go`

## Additional Notes

- This project is a basic example to illustrate the use of the Builder pattern in Go.
- You can expand and modify the implementation based on the specific needs of your application.
- Contributions and enhancements are welcome!
